Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation
dependencies as possible.

It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere"
(WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be
recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled
to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
of computer architecture.
